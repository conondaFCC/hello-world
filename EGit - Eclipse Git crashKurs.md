## Understand Git, creating a git Repository
see git.md for this.

## Create a GIT branch inside Eclipse
If you know GIT CLI, you might wanna do it there instead (Git Shell > PowerShell on Windows).

* Goto GIT perspective
* Open GIT Repository project under GIT three
* Under > Branches > Local find tree to branch then via right click option branch three (note this makes a local branch, not visible online until pushed!)
* Merging jet to be tested
* Check on what branch are we working? > project folder in the Java Perspective shows the branch name in ().

## Local Branch vs Remote Branch
Eclipse shows the local and the remote branches in the git view under branches. Standard for remote branches, a clone will set its remote to the origin. The origin does not have the remote link to the clone by default. Can be added, see git.md.
