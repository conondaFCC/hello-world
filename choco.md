# Chocolatey aka choco - package manager for windows like apt-get
This page wraps up what I learned about chocholatey and my most used features.

**Note as of 29.1.2019 I quit using chocho since it installed an old JRE of JAVA which is no longer supported by Oracle without hinting that all new JRE use should use JDK instead!**

## Installing Chocolatey
see their webpage for cmd or powershell installing Guide.

**Note: If choco is installed in hidden folder, it needs admin rights in cmd or PowerShell!**

## Usage for installing packages
start choco from cmd or PowerShell with 'choco'. If needed start cmd or PowerShell as admin!

## Chocolatey commands
| Command   | Description       |
|:----------|:------------------|
| choco /?  | list of functions |
