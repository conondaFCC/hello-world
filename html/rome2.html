  <h1>Rome 2</h1>
  <h2>Who might like it who not?</h2> Newcomers to the Totalwar Franchise will be taken away by the graphics both in the world- and the battlemap, the beautiful units and the fun it is to conquer new cities expand your Empire, build armys and cities, research. Sure this is fun. But players
  who followed the franchise a bit longer might find it just not good enough.
  <!--What do I mean?
The game didn't deliver on the expectations and the promises made.<br><br>-->

  <ul>
    <b>Main expectations and promises:</b>
    <li><b>Better AI</b> - AI was horible, today it is ok on open maps but on sieges the AI is dumb as ever maybe even worse and the sea battles - NO ONE plays them because of bad AI design</li>
    <li>?</li>
  </ul>

      <td>AI - For the Worldmap AI I know no setting that makes the Worldmap conquering interesting, after a few hours into the game it gets very repettive and boring and there is no good challange for the player. Its not broken but not any better than the
        predecessors in the franchise</td>

      <td>AI - Battle AI is ok on open maps but on sieges the AI is dumb as ever maybe even worse and the sea battles - NO ONE plays them because of bad AI design. Just let this one sink in the whole sea battle thing would be awesome but it is done in such
        a way that the players actually dont play it!</td>
